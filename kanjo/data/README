The Glasgow Norms are a corpus of 5,553 words rated on 9 different dimensions - arousal, valence, dominance, concreteness, imageability, familiarity, age of acquisition, semantic size, and gender association - with ratings, on average, from 33 participants/word.  The norms include ratings of 379 ambiguous words that were presented alone (e.g., toast) or with disambiguation (toast (bread), toast (speech)).

The Glasgow Norms are now available (online) from Behavior Research Methods (Open Access):
